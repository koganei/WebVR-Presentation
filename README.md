# WebVR-Presentation
Virtual Reality is coming fast to the general public with the Oculus Rift leading the charge. Together we'll look at
what the Oculus Rift is and how we can approach development for it. The WebVR API provided in Firefox and Chrome will
allow us to bring VR to the web using JavaScript. In the presentation, we'll learn how to integrate VR support into a
THREE.js scene so that you can start building your own VR apps.
